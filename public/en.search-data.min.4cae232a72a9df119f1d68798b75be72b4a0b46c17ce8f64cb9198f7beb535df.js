I recommend completeing at least the Algorithms unit.\r Note: The syllabus below only applies to the 2020–21 school year.\nCourse Description\r#\r\rAP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.\nAP Exam\r#\r\rThe AP Computer Science Principles Exam consists of two parts. The first is the Create task, where students will have 12 hours of class time to produce a computer program of their choosing. When complete, they will submit the program’s code, a video of the program running and written responses to the given prompts. The task is worth 30% of the exam score and is due April 30.\nThe second part is the end-of-course exam, which is 2 hours long and consists of 70 multiple-choice questions. The date of the exam is May 13 and makes up the remaining 70% of the exam score.\nUnits of Study\r#\r\r Computational Thinking Study the iterative development process and start applying it to build your own programs in Scratch. Programming Examine computational logic structures and problem solving capabilities for programs in text-based algorithms, AP-style pseudocode and Scratch. Data Representation Explore the different means of representing information digitally. Digital Media Processing Use Python to programmatically manipulate digital images and audio. Big Data Discover new knowledge through the use of large data sets. Innovative Technologies Assess the current state of technology and investigate its role in our everyday lives.  Course Framework\r#\r\rThe framework of AP Computer Science Principles includes Computational Thinking Practices and Course Content (or Big Ideas). Each of the items will appear in multiple units and lessons throughout the course.\nComputational Thinking Practices\r#\r\r Computational Solution Design Algorithms and Program Development Abstraction in Program Development Code Analysis Computing Innovations Responsible Computing  Course Content\r#\r\r Creative Development Data Algorithms and Programming Computing Systems and Networks and Impact of Computing  Course Format and Procedures\r#\r\rThis course is run through Edhesive which provides an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. Because of this, the course is mostly self-paced. Keep in mind that for any work assigned during a marking period, you must complete it during that marking period to earn credit.

This one-semester course is for those with an interest in computer programming, whether it’s a career goal or just curiosity. It covers storing values in variables, using functions to manipulate those variables, and controlling the flow of those functions with repetition and conditionals. By the end, students will be able to create simple games and write scripts to accomplish repetitive tasks. The language used is Python.\nUnits of Study\r#\r\r Beginning in Computer Science Introduces the idea of computer science and writing your first program.

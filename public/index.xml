      <description>Yearbook Club#2021–2022
Yearbook Club is for students who wish to contribute to Valorem but are not enrolled in Yearbook Publishing. All are welcome and the only requirement for membership is to be a regular contributor. That means conducting interviews or submitting photos that document the who and what of the school year.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can visit me in room 47 or reach out through email. Meetings will happen based on individual availability.</description>

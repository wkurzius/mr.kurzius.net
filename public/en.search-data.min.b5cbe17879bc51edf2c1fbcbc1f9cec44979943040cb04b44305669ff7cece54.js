More than a traditional introduction to programming, it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming our world.\nAP Exam\r#\r\rThe AP CSP Exam consists of two parts. The first is the Create Performance Task where students will have 12 hours of class time to produce a computer program of their choosing. Submission includes the program’s code, a video of the program running and written responses to the given prompts. The task is worth 30% of the exam score and is due TBD.\nThe remaining 70% is the End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Exam. It consists of 70 multiple-choice questions and takes place on TBD.\nUnits of Study\r#\r\r Introduction to Programming Covers the the basics of programming and looks at privacy concerns and the internet. Abstraction How to hide the complexity of a program, both from the programmer and the user. We\u0026rsquo;ll also look at copyrights and fair use. Data Structures Using lists to manage more complex data and also the role of AI and automation in the world. How the Internet Works All about the internet including some history, security issues and how data is transmitted. Algorithms and Data Analyzing how effecient a program is at producing results and the effect of computing in warfare.  Course Format and Miscellaneous\r#\r\rThis course will use the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum which is developed by UC Berkeley. A large part of the course will have students work in Snap!, an advanced block-based programming language.\nAlso \u0026hellip;\n Grading is point-based Late work loses two percentage points per day with a floor of 70% There is no final exam Question?

This one-semester course is for those with an interest in computer programming, whether it’s a career goal or just curiosity. It covers storing values in variables, using functions to manipulate those variables, and controlling the flow of those functions with repetition and conditionals. By the end, students will be able to create simple games and write scripts to accomplish repetitive tasks. The language used is Python.\nUnits of Study\r#\r\r Creating Drawings Learn the basics of programming by creating simple drawings. Functions, Mouse Events and Properties Programs in your programs. Write code that can process information and be easily reused. Mouse Motion Events, Conditionals, and Helper Functions Your first taste of artificial intellgence.

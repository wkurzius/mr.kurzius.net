## About

{{<div avatar>}}
![Mr. Kurzius](images/avatar.jpg)
{{</div>}}

I’m in my eighteenth year of teaching, all in Manville. This year my courses include AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science Principles, Intro to Programming, Intro to Web Development, and Engineering Design I. I’m also the district communication coordinator. I have a degree in Computer Science from TCNJ and I’m certified in NJ to teach computer science and math.

I’m interested in most things related to computers, photography, and if you ever need to distract me from doing my job, ask me something about video games.

My wife is also a teacher at Manville; she teaches eighth grade science at ABIS. Our daughter Lucy is ten, but doesn’t have a teaching job yet.

## About

{{</div>}}

I’m in my nineteenth year of teaching, all in Manville. This year my courses include Algebra I, AP Computer Science A, Honors Calculus and Math Strategies. I'm also the advisor for the school's Esports program. I have a degree in Computer Science from TCNJ and I’m certified in NJ to teach computer science and math.

I’m interested in most things related to computers, photography, and if you ever need to distract me from doing my job, ask me something about video games.

My wife is also a teacher at Manville; she teaches eighth grade science at ABIS. Our daughter Lucy is eleven, ~~but doesn’t have a teaching job yet~~ and is a junior taekwondo instructor.

# Intro to Programming

## Course Description

A computer is basically lightning trapped inside a rock and programming is telling the lighting what it should do. This one-semester course is for those with an interest in computer programming, whether itâ€™s a career goal or just curiosity. It covers storing values in variables, using functions to manipulate those variables, and controlling the flow of those functions with repetition and conditionals. By the end, students will be able to create simple games and write scripts to accomplish repetitive tasks. The language used is Python.

## Units of Study

Beginning in Computer Science
: Introduces the idea of computer science and writing your first program.

Number Calculations and Data
: Using programs to make calculations and work with data.

Making Decisions
: Introduction to IF/THEN statements and basic AI.

Repetition and Loops
: Repetition of code to parse lists and large amounts of data.

Programming in EarSketch
: Using the Python language to create music.

## Format and Procedures

This course is run through Edhesive which provides an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. Because of this, the course is mostly self-paced. Keep in mind that for any work assigned during a marking period, you must complete it during that marking period to earn credit. The exceptions to the self-paced rule are exams, quizzes and any group projects.

In the final unit, students will program music and sound using EarSketch.

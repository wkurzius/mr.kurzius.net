# Yearbook Club
_2021â€“2022_

Yearbook Club is for students who wish to contribute to Valorem without being enrolled in Yearbook Publishing. All are welcome and the only requirement for membership is to be a regular contributor. That means conducting interviews, submitting photos or writing articles that document the who and what of the school year.

If you're interested, reach out through email or Google Chat. Meetings will happen based on individual availability.

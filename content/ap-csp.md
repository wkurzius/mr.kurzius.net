# AP Computer Science Principles

## Summer Work

Although we will follow the Edhesive program come fall, students that want to get a jump start on the material should check out the resources and exercises on Khan Academy. This is optional summer work but students should be prepared for a fast-paced beginning of the year. With that in mind, I recommend you work through at least the Algorithms unit.

Once I have an official roster and the Edhesive course is active, students will receive registration information and starter activities to help them get familiar with the course format.

## Course Description

AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.

## AP Exam

The AP Computer Science Principles Exam consists of two parts. The first is the Create task, where students will have 12 hours of class time to produce a computer program of their choosing. When complete, they will submit the program’s code, a video of the program running and written responses to the given prompts. The task is worth 30% of the exam score and is due April 30.

The second part is the end-of-course exam, which is 2 hours long and consists of 70 multiple-choice questions. The date of the exam is May 13 and makes up the remaining 70% of the exam score.

## Units of Study

Computational Thinking
: Study the iterative development process and start applying it to build your own programs in Scratch.

Programming
: Examine computational logic structures and problem solving capabilities for programs in text-based algorithms, AP-style pseudocode and Scratch.

Data Representation
: Explore the different means of representing information digitally.

Digital Media Processing
: Use Python to programmatically manipulate digital images and audio.

Big Data
: Discover new knowledge through the use of large data sets.

Innovative Technologies
: Assess the current state of technology and investigate its role in our everyday lives.

## Course Framework

The framework of AP Computer Science Principles includes Computational Thinking Practices and Course Content (or Big Ideas). Each of the items will appear in multiple units and lessons throughout the course.

### Computational Thinking Practices

1. Computational Solution Design
2. Algorithms and Program Development
3. Abstraction in Program Development
4. Code Analysis
5. Computing Innovations
6. Responsible Computing

### Course Content

1. Creative Development
2. Data
3. Algorithms and Programming
4. Computing Systems and Networks
5. and Impact of Computing

## Course Format and Procedures

This course is run through Edhesive which provides an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. Because of this, the course is mostly self-paced. Keep in mind that for any work assigned during a marking period, you must complete it during that marking period to earn credit. The exceptions to the self-paced rule are exams, quizzes and any group projects.

Along with Edhesive, students will spend a significant amount of time programming in Scratch and also using Repl.it for working with Python.

### Start of Class

- Drop your bags in the back of the room since there is little room in the rows
- Silence your cell phones and put them away
- Look to the board for work or directions
- Get materials ready (sharpen pencils, notebooks out, etc.)
- Log in to the computer and Edhesive

### During Class

- Take notes during lessons, which includes lessons you complete on your own
- Please remain in your seat during a lesson (bathroom is the exception)
- Keep cell phones away, I will help with this if needed
- If you need to use the bathroom, you may take the pass and ask me to sign it
- If you get stuck while working on a problem, ask the people around you or try the student forums
- Make mistakes and accept criticism

### End of Class

- Clean up after yourself
- Pick up one piece of garbage on your way out
- Wait to be dismissed

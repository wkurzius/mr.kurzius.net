# Algebra I
_2023–2024_

## Course Description
This course focuses on deepening understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other. Students will apply linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend, and also engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions.

## Units of Study
1 Limits and Continuity
: Explore how limits allow solving problems involving change and to better understand mathematical reasoning about functions.

2 Differentiation: Definition and Fundamental Properties
: Apply limits to define the derivative, become skillful at determining derivatives, and continue to develop mathematical reasoning skills.

3 Differentiation: Composite, Implicit, and Inverse Functions:
: Master using the chain rule, develop new differentiation techniques, and be introduced to higher-order derivatives.

4 Contextual Applications of Differentiation
: Apply derivatives to set up and solve real-world problems involving instantaneous rates of change and use mathematical reasoning to determine limits of certain indeterminate forms.

5 Analytical Applications of Differentiation
: Explore relationships among the graphs of a function and its derivatives, and learn to apply calculus to solve optimization problems.

6 Integration and Accumulation of Change
: Apply limits to define definite integrals and how the Fundamental Theorem connects integration and differentiation. Apply properties of integrals and practice useful integration techniques.

7 Differential Equations
: Solve certain differential equations and apply that knowledge to further understand exponential growth and decay.

8 Applications of Integration
: Make mathematical connections that will allow solving a wide range of problems involving net change over an interval of time and to find areas of regions or volumes of solids defined using functions.

## Miscellaneous
We will use the book _Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic_ (AP ed., 5th ed.) as reference and for homework assignments, though I recommend Khan Academy as a first stop for any extra practice. They have both an [AP Calculus AB](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab) course and a [Get ready for AP Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-calc) course. I suggest reviewing the latter prior to any new chapter.

You will also have access to TI-84 Plus calculators in class, and an emulator of the same is on your Chromebooks. Purchasing your own is not a bad idea if you have the means, but *not* required in any way shape or form. I still have a TI-89 from my freshman year of college over 20 years ago, so it’s worth considering if you anticipate using it after this course. For a list of acceptable calculators, see [this list from College Board](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies#list). You want calculators with an asterisk after their name.

Also ...

- Grading is point-based. Homework assignments are worth 1 point, quizzes 10 points and exams 25.
- Homework is due at the end of the chapter, but zeroes will go in the grade book in the meantime
- Late homework loses two percentage points per day with a floor of 70%
- Ask your classmates first if you have a question
- Please pick up a piece of garbage on your way out of the classroom

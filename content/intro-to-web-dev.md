## Course Description

Anyone who’s anyone has their own website and this is where you can make yours. This one-semester course focuses on the front-end of web development, or the stuff that everyone sees. This includes structure with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), style with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and will have students begin to build a portfolio of work for future employment.

## Units of Study

Responsive Web Design Projects
: Apply your newly learned skills to produce responsive websites that you can can use to build your portfolio of work.

## Format and Procedures

This course is run through freeCodeCamp which provides an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. Because of this, the course is mostly self-paced. Keep in mind that for any work assigned during a marking period, you must complete it during that marking period to earn credit. The exceptions to the self-paced rule are exams and projects.

Along with freeCodeCamp, students will use CodePen and GitHub for developing and publishing their projects.

## Certification

This course follows FreeCodeCamp’s path to a Responsive Web Design Certification. The estimated time to complete the items is 300 hours, much more time than we have available in a semester. But the goal is to complete all the exercises and two of the five projects, leaving the final three for them to complete on their own if they wish to earn the certificate.

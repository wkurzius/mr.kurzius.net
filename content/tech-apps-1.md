# Technology Applications & Design I

## Course Description

This course allows students to proceed through hands-on learning that will include design and problem solving activities. Students will use the engineering process to identify requirements and restrictions of a problem, design a solution, build it and determine if it solves that problem. The course will also have students look at engineering career paths along with technology’s impact on society.

## Format and Procedures

Report to the workshop at the beginning of each day’s class. Lessons will occur in the workshop along will all building. The computer lab is reserved for design and research.

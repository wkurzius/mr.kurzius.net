# Math Strategies
_2021–2022_

## Course Description

Students who—based on multiple measures including PARCC assessments—have been identified as needing additional support in mathematics will be recommended for and placed into the Mathematics Strategies course. This course is designed to prepare students to meet the current state graduation requirements established by the NJ Department of Education. Placement is determined by administration. 

## Graduation Assessment Requirements Explained

Aside from passing courses and earning credits, in order to graduate high school you must also demonstrate proficiency in both English and math on an approved assessment. There are a number of approved assessments (e.g. NJSLA/PARCC, SAT, Accuplacer) along with a portfolio option. Meeting the threshhold on any one these assessments will allow you to graduate.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous

The ultimate goal of this course is for each student to pass the portfolio assessment option with a completed portfolio consisting of correct reponses to four open-ended questions. Classtime will be spent preparing for each question and then each student must answer the question on their own.

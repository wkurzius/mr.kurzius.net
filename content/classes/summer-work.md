# AP Summer Work 2023

All the work below is recommended, but not required.

## AP/Honors Calculus
Work through the [Getting Ready for AP Calculus course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-calc) on Khan Academy. I suggest starting with the quizzes to see where you need work.

## AP Computer Science A
Work through the first two units in Carnegie Mellon's [CS1: Intro to Programming](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/new-student/KR27-WR21). That link will take you to registration page with a code prefilled. Once you are comfortable with a topic, feel free to move on to the next one. There is no need to complete every exercise, and you can skip the creative tasks and quizzes.

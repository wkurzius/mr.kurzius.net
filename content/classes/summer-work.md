# Summer Work 2024

The work below is recommended, but not required.

## AP Calculus
Work through the appropriate Get Ready course on Khan Academy. Each has a Course Challenge that will tell you where you need to focus.

- [Get ready for AP Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-calc)
<!-- - [Get ready for Algebra 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-algebra-ii) -->

<!-- ## AP Computer Science A
Work through the first two units in Carnegie Mellon's [CS1: Intro to Programming](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/new-student/KR27-WR21). That link will take you to registration page with a code prefilled. Once you are comfortable with a topic, feel free to move on to the next one. There is no need to complete every exercise, and you can skip the creative tasks and quizzes. -->

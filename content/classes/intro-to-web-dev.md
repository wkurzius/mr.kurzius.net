# Intro to Web Development
_2022–2023_

## Course Description

Anyone who’s anyone has their own website, and this is where you can make yours. This one-semester course focuses on the front-end of web development, or the stuff that everyone sees. This includes structure with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), style with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and will have students begin to build a portfolio of work for future employment.

## Units of Study

HTML, CSS and Forms
: Learn how to define the structure of a webpage with HTML and then style it with CSS. You'll apply this by building some online forms.

Flexbox, Typography and Accessibility
: Advanced positions of page elements with text styling and learning to design for accessibility.

Intermediate CSS and Responsive Web Design
: Various advanced styling topic along with ensuring your pages look good on all devices.

CSS Variables and Grid
: Learn how to use variables to manage more complex and styles, along with the grid model, which is another method of positioning page elements.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous

This course uses the Responsive Web Design curriculum provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which serves an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. The course is mostly self-paced, so students can learn at their own speed. Because of this, grading is based on the amount of the course students complete with earlier units being worth much more than later ones. 

Also …

- There is no final exam
- Question? Ask your classmates first.
- Pick up a piece of garbage on your way out of the classroom

## Certification

This course follows freeCodeCamp’s path to a Responsive Web Design Certification. The estimated time to complete the items is 300 hours, much more time than we have available in a semester, but I encourage interested students to pursue the remaining lessons and projects to complete the program.

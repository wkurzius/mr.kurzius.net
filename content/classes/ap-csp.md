## Summer Work

Sudents that want a jump start on the material should check out the resources and exercises on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles). I recommend completeing at least the Algorithms unit.

## Course Description

Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. More than a traditional introduction to programming, it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming our world.

## AP Exam

The AP CSP Exam consists of two parts. The first is the Create Performance Task where students will have 12 hours of class time to produce a computer program of their choosing. Submission includes the program’s code, a video of the program running and written responses to the given prompts. The task is worth 30% of the exam score and is due May 2, 2022.

The remaining 70% is the End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Exam. It consists of 70 multiple-choice questions and takes place on May 9, 2022.

## Units of Study

Computational Thinking
: Study the iterative development process and start applying it to build your own programs in Scratch.

Programming
: Examine computational logic structures and problem solving capabilities for programs in text-based algorithms, AP-style pseudocode and Scratch.

Data Representation
: Explore the different means of representing information digitally.

Digital Media Processing
: Use Python to programmatically manipulate digital images and audio.

Big Data
: Discover new knowledge through the use of large data sets.

Innovative Technologies
: Assess the current state of technology and investigate its role in our everyday lives.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous

This course will use the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum which is developed by the UC Berkeley (https://bjc.edc.org). A large part of the course will have students work in Snap<em>!</em>, an advanced block-based programming language ([https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html)).

Also ...

- Grading is point-based
- There is no final exam
- Question? Ask your classmates first
- Pick up a piece of garbage on your way out of the classroom

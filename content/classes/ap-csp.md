## Summer Work

Sudents that want a jump start on the material should check out the resources and exercises on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles). I recommend completeing at least the Algorithms unit.

## Course Description

Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. More than a traditional introduction to programming, it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the foundational ideas of computing so all students understand how these concepts are transforming our world.

## AP Exam

The AP CSP Exam consists of two parts. The first is the Create Performance Task where students will have 12 hours of class time to produce a computer program of their choosing. Submission includes the program’s code, a video of the program running and written responses to the given prompts. The task is worth 30% of the exam score and is due May 2, 2022.

The remaining 70% is the End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Exam. It consists of 70 multiple-choice questions and takes place on May 9, 2022.

## Units of Study

Introduction to Programming
: Covers the the basics of programming and looks at privacy concerns and the internet.

Abstraction
: How to hide the complexity of a program, both from the programmer and the user. We'll also look at copyrights and fair use.

Data Structures
: Using lists to manage more complex data and also the role of AI and automation in the world.

How the Internet Works
: All about the internet including some history, security issues and how data is transmitted.

Algorithms and Data
: Analyzing how effecient a program is at producing results and the effect of computing in warfare.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous

This course will use the [Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum](https://bjc.edc.org/) which is developed by UC Berkeley. A large part of the course will have students work in [Snap<em>!</em>, an advanced block-based programming language](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html).

Also ...

- Grading is point-based
- Late work loses two percentage points per day with a floor of 70%
- There is no final exam
- Question? Ask your classmates first
- Pick up a piece of garbage on your way out of the classroom

# Yearbook Publishing
_2021–2022_

## Course Description

This course is designed to teach students to apply the basic principles of journalism, graphic design and page layout in the production of the high school’s yearbook, Valorem. Students will also gain computer experience through the utilization of desktop publishing software. Additionally, students will become proficient at small business operations in the sales and marketing of these publications.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous

In the beginning of the year, class time will be more structured as there are a lot of introductory lessons on how to create a yearbook. The book itself also needs to be planned out, which includes what content will be on each page and the theme of the book.

Later, the class becomes more free form each person will be working on their assigned pages and topics. **Expect to spend a significant amount of time outside of class conducting interviews and covering events.**

# Intro to Programming
_2021–2022_

## Course Description

A computer is basically lightning trapped inside a rock and programming is telling the lighting what it should do. This one-semester course is for those with an interest in computer programming, whether it’s a career goal or just curiosity. It covers storing values in variables, using functions to manipulate those variables, and controlling the flow of those functions with repetition and conditionals. By the end, students will be able to create simple games and write scripts to accomplish repetitive tasks. The language used is Python.

## Units of Study

Creating Drawings
: Learn the basics of programming by creating simple drawings.

Functions, Mouse Events and Properties
: Programs in your programs. Write code that can process information and be easily reused.

Mouse Motion Events, Conditionals, and Helper Functions
: Your first taste of artificial intellgence. Teach your program to make decisions by telling it "if this, do that".

More Conditionals, Key Events, and Methods
: Now it's "if this, do that or else".

Complex Conditionals and More Key Events
: "If this and that, or if this other thing but not that one, then ..."

Groups, Step Events, and Motion
: Moving pictures, but I like to call them move-ies.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous

This course uses the CS1 curriculum provided by [Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu). It provides an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. The course is mostly self-paced because of this, so feel free to jump ahead. Just keep in mind that you must complete work during the marking period it was assigned.

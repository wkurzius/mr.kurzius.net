# Algebra II and Trigonometry Honors
_2024–2025_

## Course Description
This course will explore analyzing equations and inequalities, graphing linear relations and functions, solving systems of linear equations and inequalities, polynomials and radical expressions, quadratic functions and inequalities, polynomial functions, rational expressions, and exponential and logarithmic functions. This specific Algebra II pathway will emphasize trigonometry. Honors courses provide a deeper and more extensive depth of content.

9 Introduction to Graphing with Trigonometric Functions
: 

## Grading
- The official gradebook will exist on Canvas, with Genesis only having the overall grade.
- Grading is point-based, though assignments are worth roughly 10%, quizzes 40%, and tests 50% of your marking period grade. 
- Quizzes will happen after every two or three sections, with major tests once a marking period.
- Late work will receive only partial credit.

## Miscellaneous
We will use the book _Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic_ (AP ed., 5th ed.) as reference and for homework assignments, though I recommend Khan Academy as a first stop for any extra practice. They have both an [AP Calculus AB](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab) course and a [Get ready for AP Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-calc) course. I suggest reviewing the latter prior to any new chapter.

You will also have access to TI-84 Plus calculators in class, and an emulator of the same is on your Chromebooks. Purchasing your own is not a bad idea if you have the means, but *not* required in any way shape or form. I still have a TI-89 from my freshman year of college over 20 years ago, so it’s worth considering if you anticipate using it after this course. For a list of acceptable calculators, see [this list from College Board](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies#list). You want calculators with an asterisk after their name.

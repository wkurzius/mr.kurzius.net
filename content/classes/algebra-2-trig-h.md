# Algebra II and Trigonometry Honors
_2024â€“2025_

## Course Description
This course will explore analyzing equations and inequalities, graphing linear relations and functions, solving systems of linear equations and inequalities, polynomials and radical expressions, quadratic functions and inequalities, polynomial functions, rational expressions, and exponential and logarithmic functions. This specific Algebra II pathway will emphasize trigonometry. Honors courses provide a deeper and more extensive depth of content.

## Units of Study
1 Functions and Inequalities
: Mostly a review of function notation, parent functions, their transformations and various other Algebra I topics.

2 Quadratics Equations: Graphing and Solving
: Along with graphing quadratics, this unit focuses on various strategies for solving them. This includes factoring and the zero-product property, completing the square and the quadratic formula. 

3 Higher Order Polynomial Functions
: All things related to working with polynomials. This includes synthetic division and long division, and graph analysis.

4 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
: You'll be introduced to geometric sequences and series, along with reviewing the properties of exponents to apply them to the properties of logarithms.

5 Rational Functions
: Learn how to graph rational functions by identifying holes, asymptotes, and intercepts as well as the end behavior of the function.

6 Radical Functions
: All about how to add, subtract, multiply and divide radical expressions as well as solve radical equations.

7 Right Triangle Trigonometry and The Unit Circle
: This starts with a review of concepts introduced in Geometry and earlier, but then moves into the trigonometric ratios of right triangles.

8 Other Triangle Trigonometry 
: The law of sines and cosines and how to solve missing sides or angles in non-right triangles.

9 Introduction to Graphing with Trigonometric Functions
: Graphing the sine and cosine curves along with applying them to real world problems.

## Grading
- The official gradebook will exist on Canvas, with Genesis only having the overall grade.
- Grading is point-based, though assignments are worth roughly 10%, quizzes 40%, and tests 50% of your marking period grade.
- Quizzes will happen after every two or three sections, with major tests once a marking period.
- Late work will receive only partial credit.

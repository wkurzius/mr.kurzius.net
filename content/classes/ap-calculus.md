_2022–2023_

{{< div summer-work >}}

## Summer Work
I recommend completing the [Get ready for AP Calculus course on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-calc).

## Course Description
Explore the concepts, methods, and applications of differential and integral calculus. You’ll work to understand the theoretical basis and solve problems by applying your knowledge and skills. You'll learn how to determine expressions and values using mathematical procedures and rules; connect representations; justify reasoning and solutions; and use correct notation, language, and mathematical conventions to communicate results or solutions

## AP Exam
The AP exams is 3 hours and 15 minute long and include 45 multiple-choice questions and 6 free-response questions. A calculator is not permitted on 30 of the multiple-choice questions and 4 of the free-response questions. The exam takes place on **Monday, May 8 at 8 a.m.**

## Units of Study
1 Limits and Continuity
: You’ll start to explore how limits will allow you to solve problems involving change and to better understand mathematical reasoning about functions.

2 Differentiation: Definition and Fundamental Properties
: You’ll apply limits to define the derivative, become skillful at determining derivatives, and continue to develop mathematical reasoning skills.

3 Differentiation: Composite, Implicit, and Inverse Functions:
: You’ll master using the chain rule, develop new differentiation techniques, and be introduced to higher-order derivatives.

4 Contextual Applications of Differentiation
: You’ll apply derivatives to set up and solve real-world problems involving instantaneous rates of change and use mathematical reasoning to determine limits of certain indeterminate forms.

5 Analytical Applications of Differentiation
: After exploring relationships among the graphs of a function and its derivatives, you'll learn to apply calculus to solve optimization problems.

6 Integration and Accumulation of Change
: You’ll learn to apply limits to define definite integrals and how the Fundamental Theorem connects integration and differentiation. You’ll apply properties of integrals and practice useful integration techniques.

7 Differential Equations
: You’ll learn how to solve certain differential equations and apply that knowledge to deepen your understanding of exponential growth and decay.

8 Applications of Integration
: You’ll make mathematical connections that will allow you to solve a wide range of problems involving net change over an interval of time and to find areas of regions or volumes of solids defined using functions.

## Course Format and Miscellaneous
This course will use the [Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum](https://bjc.edc.org/) which is developed by UC Berkeley. A large part of the course will have students work in [Snap<em>!</em>, an advanced block-based programming language](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html).

Also ...

- Grading is point-based
- Late work loses two percentage points per day with a floor of 70%
- There is no final exam
- Question? Ask your classmates first
- Pick up a piece of garbage on your way out of the classroom
